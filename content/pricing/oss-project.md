    title: Pulumi Open Source Program
    description: |
        At the core of Pulumi is an open source project and an engaged community. Pulumi exists thanks
        to the work of hundreds of open source contributors around the world. As a company, we are
        deeply committed to being a good steward of the Pulumi open source project. As a way to
        give back to the community, the Pulumi Open Source Program was created to help open source
        projects and teams innovate and scale faster through cloud engineering.
